The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. 
The goal is to move the entire stack of disks from one rod to another, following two rules: 
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time. 
2) A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Code:

#include <stdio.h>

void hanoi(int n, char A, char B, char C) {
    if(n == 1)
{
  printf("Move disk 1 from %c to %c\n", A, C);
return;
}
    hanoi(n-1, A, C, B);
printf("Move disk %d from %c to %c\n", n, A, C);
 hanoi(n-1, B, A, C);
}

int main() 
{
  
int n;
printf("Enter number of disks: ");
    
scanf("%d", &n);

 hanoi(n, 'A', 'B', 'C');
return 0; }
